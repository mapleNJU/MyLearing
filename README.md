# MyLearing

Hi,I'm maple.

I'm learning machine learing and algorithm now.

I'm a fresh man, and disire victory.

My favorite is taking photo and listening music.

My favorite song is 'Spring March' of Si-Nan, a Chinese female singer who likes to sing ancient songs. I have listened this song over 3,000 times.

If in need, you can contact me by email:mapletree.dream **at** gmail.com

Thank you, let's progress together!
