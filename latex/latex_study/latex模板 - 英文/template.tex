\subsection{[This is the Title of Subsection 1.1]}
[Both display mode and in-line mode are supported for typesetting formulas. $\sum_{n = 1} ^ {\infty} 1/n^2 = \pi^2/6 $]

$$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$

[If you want to get your formula numbered, use \texttt{equation} environment.]

  \begin{equation} \label{fourier}
    \mathcal{F}[f](\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2\pi ix \xi} dx
  \end{equation}

[Here is a reference to the equation above: Eq. \ref{fourier} gives the Fourier transform of function $f$.]

  [Also, you can use other mathematical environments like \texttt{split}, \texttt{align} and \texttt{gather}, if necessary:]
  \begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    (x+y)^4 &= (x+y)^2 (x+y)^2 \\
            &= (x^2+2xy+y^2)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \\
            &= x^4 + 4x^3y+6x^2y^2+4xy^3+y^4
  \end{split}
  \end{equation}

  \begin{align}
    \oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d \mathbf{s} &= \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}
                                              \label{maxwell:begin} \\
    \oint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d \mathbf{s} &= 0 \\
    \oint_L \mathbf{E} \cdot d \mathbf{l} &= -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \\
    \oint_L \mathbf{B} \cdot d \mathbf{l} &= \mu_0 I +
               \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt} \label{maxwell:end}
  \end{align}
  [Eq. \ref{maxwell:begin} $\sim$ \ref{maxwell:end} are together called the
Maxwell's equations.]
  \begin{gather}
    (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2      \notag   \\
    (a + b) \cdot (a - b) = a^2 - b^2
  \end{gather}


\subsection{[This is the Title of Subsection 1.2]}
[To make a citation to the articles listed in \texttt{thebibliography} environment (at the end of the document), use \texttt{supercite} command. The number of the cited articles will be generated automatically. For example:]

[This is sample text. This is sample text\supercite{chendh, whiteside} This is sample text. This is sample text. This is sample text. This is sample text\supercite{calms}, This is sample text. This is sample text. This is sample text. This is sample text. This is sample text. This is sample text. This is sample text. This is sample text. This is sample text. This is sample text.

This is sample text. This is sample text. This is sample text\supercite{obrien}. This is sample text. This is sample text. ]

[You can use \texttt{itemize} or \texttt{enumerate} environment to typeset unordered or ordered list. This is an unordered list:]
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is item 1;
    \item This is item 2; and
    \item This is item 3.
\end{itemize}

[This is an ordered list:]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This is item 1;
    \item This is item 2; and
    \item This is item 3.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{[This is the Title of Subsection 1.3]}
 [Here is an example of figure.]
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/fig1.png}
  \caption{[This is a PNG picture.]} \label{pngsample}
\end{figure}

[Also, you can make a reference to a figure which is already labeled. For example: Fig. \ref{pngsample} is a sample PNG picture.]

[You may use \texttt{subfigure} to typeset subfigures, and you can make a reference to a specific subfigure, if labelled. For example: Fig. \ref{fig:subfig:d} is subfigure 4.]
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \subfigure[Sample 1]{
      \label{fig:subfig:a}
      \includegraphics[width=3.5cm]{figures/sub1.png}}
    \hspace{1in}
    \subfigure[Sample 2]{
      \label{fig:subfig:b}
      \includegraphics[width=3.5cm]{figures/sub2.png}}
    \hspace{1in} \\
    \subfigure[Sample 3]{
      \label{fig:subfig:c}
      \includegraphics[width=3.5cm]{figures/sub3.png}}
    \hspace{1in}
    \subfigure[Sample 4]{
      \label{fig:subfig:d}
      \includegraphics[width=3.5cm]{figures/sub4.png}}
    \caption{[These are subfigures.]}
    \label{fig:subfig}
  \end{figure}
